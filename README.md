# flappy_ironman

This is Flappy Ironman game inspired by Flappy Game.
No external game engine packages are used.


For more information => See screenshots folder and walkthrough video.

There are tons of calculation in the game. So, when playing the game, think of Ironman as a square box not a man. He may die due to touching the block with his edge of box even without touching with his actual body.
Sorry for that inconvenience. But the inaccuracy is only a little bit. I tried as much as I can to be accurate.
So! Feel free to enjoy the game. 😀😀
